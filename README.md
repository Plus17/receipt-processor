## Content

This boilerplate comes with batteries included, youâ€™ll find:

* Gems:
  * Removes Gems that cause problems:
    - Turbolinks makes your app feel slow and broken
    - Spring creates an unstable development environment
  * Gems for better testing:
    - Factory Bot to manage test data
    - Faker to provide fake values for that data
    - minitest-reporters to get more useful test run output
  * Gems for development:
    - dotenv-rails to allow management of local UNIX environments
    - foreman to run multiple processes locally
    - standard for no-brainer style guide
  * Gems for managing security issues:
    - Brakeman
    - bundler-audit
  * Gems for better production behavior:
    - lograge for single-line logging
    - sidekiq for background jobs
    - Postgres
  * Gems for asset pipeline:
    -  propshaft
    -  jsbundling-rails
    -  cssbundling-rails
* Dev Workflow
  - `bin/setup` that does a more involved setup
  - `bin/ci` runs all quality checks (tests, brakeman, bundle audit, yarn audit)
  - `bin/run` runs the app locally
  - `bin/sql` get a SQL prompt to your local database
  - `bin/db-{migrate,rollback}` - migrate and rollback  both dev and test in one command
  - `bin/release` - Release phase script for Heroku to run migrations
* Other Things
  - Removes `config/database.yml` and `config/secrets.yml` because your app will get all configuration from `ENV`
  - SQL-based schema management so you can use any feature of Postgres you like
  - No stylesheets or helpers generated by generators since they provide a false sense of modularity that is of
  zero benefit.
  - All `datetime` fields in migrations uses `timestamp with time zone` which is the proper type in Postgres.
  - A test to lint all your factories
  - Tailwind for frontend
## Setup

1. Pull down the app from version control
2. Make sure you have Postgres and Redis running
3. `bin/setup`

## Running The App

1. `bin/run`

## Tests and CI

1. `bin/ci` contains all the tests and checks for the app
1. `tmp/test.log` will use the production logging format
    *not* the development one.

## Production

* All runtime configuration should be supplied
  in the UNIX environment
* Rails logging uses lograge. `bin/setup help`
  can tell you how to see this locally
